Here you have a list of all "Known Hosts" from your "known_hosts" file.
If you want to remove one key from a Host, toggle the button of the specific Key.
If you want to remove the whole host, just toggle the button on the top label.

The three bottom buttons:

- Left: Cancel & Dismiss
- Middle: Reload file and revert all changes
- Right: Accept changes and write them to disk

## Plans for the future

- [ ] Add functionality for putting a key onto a Server
- [ ] Beautify UI
- [ ] Add functionality for editing authorized_keys
- many more not yet known!
